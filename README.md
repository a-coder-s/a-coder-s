- 👋 Hi, I’m Avin@a-coder-s.
- 👀 I’m interested in assembling PCs, tinkering with Arduino/RPi, ML, gaming/games, learning and discovery, among a lot of other stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with Pygame, git/github, VScode, Selenium and a few other things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing for now.
- 📫 How to reach me ... TBD.
